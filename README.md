# Computational Intelligence Tutorial
In this repository, we will cover the material of the Computational Intelligence course which originated in University of Guilan. This repo will demonstrate how you could implement Metaheuristic Algorithms in Python. Therefore, if you are interested in learning the implementation of Metaheuristic Algorithms and understanding them with cool visualization techniques, this is the right place for you. (The goal of making this content was enabling others to learn Metaheuristic Algorithms on their own; therefore, if you can't be present in the class, you can learn all of the material using this repository.)

# Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, you should know:
* Python - If you don't know python, but you know how to program, you can learn it in <a href="https://github.com/Computational-Intelligence-Fall18/Python-Numpy-Instructor-Codes/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20Python%20and%20Numpy/Python.ipynb">first week</a> of this class.
* Numpy Library - If you don't know Numpy, you can learn it in <a href="https://github.com/Computational-Intelligence-Fall18/Computational-Intelligence-Tutorials/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20Python%20and%20Numpy/Numpy.ipynb">first week</a> of this class.
* Algorithms & Datastructures - If you don't know Algorithms & Datastructures, you can learn it <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513">here</a>.
