# Computational Intelligence Tutorial
This repository will cover the material of the Computational Intelligence class. In this class, we will show how you could implement Metaheuristic Algorithms in python. So If you are interested in Metaheuristic Algorithms, This is the place for you. (The goal of making this content was anyone can be able to learn Metaheuristic Algorithms on their own, So if you can't be present in the class, you can learn all of the material here.)

# Prerequisites
Before you start this tutorial, you should know:
* Python - If you don't know python, but you know how to program, you can learn it in <a href="https://github.com/Computational-Intelligence-Fall18/Python-Numpy-Instructor-Codes/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20Python%20and%20Numpy/Python.ipynb">first week</a> of this class.
* Numpy Library - If you don't know Numpy, you can learn it in <a href="https://github.com/Computational-Intelligence-Fall18/Computational-Intelligence-Tutorials/blob/master/Week%201%20-%20Intro%20to%20Python%20and%20Numpy/Numpy.ipynb">first week</a> of this class.
* Algorithms & Datastructures - If you don't know Algorithms & Datastructures, you can learn it <a href="https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513">here</a>.
